# Dashboard & Projects UI Consistency Plan

## Notes
- Dashboard card hover effects now use subtle light gray/white, not extreme black/white.
- Dashboard is considered complete by the user.
- User requests that all external links in the dashboard be checked; if any are not working, show an "Under Development" page.
- All external links in Dashboard checked; none found—task considered complete.
- Next priority is ensuring uniform design in the Projects page.
- Projects page (ProjectsList.js) needs design consistency improvements: button styling, card hover effect, border/shadow, spacing, and typography.
- Projects page root-level layout updated to match Dashboard (padding/margin now consistent).
- Projects page background must be entirely black or white (remove any blue backgrounds).
- All non-dashboard internal pages must include a "Back to Dashboard" button for navigation.
- Backend is fully functional with clearly defined REST API routes.
- Frontend has partial implementation; some pages/components are incomplete or inconsistent.
- The following must remain untouched unless absolutely necessary: Landing Page, Login Page, Register Page, Sidebar Component.
- All changes should be incremental and tested fragment-by-fragment.
- Final deliverable includes a backend–frontend route map.
- Backend is fully functional with clearly defined REST API routes.
- Frontend has partial implementation; some pages/components are incomplete or inconsistent.
- The following must remain untouched unless absolutely necessary: Landing Page, Login Page, Register Page, Sidebar Component.
- All changes should be incremental and tested fragment-by-fragment.
- Final deliverable includes a backend–frontend route map.
- Backend route discovery complete. Main routes found:
  - /api/auth: register, login, OAuth callbacks, profile (GET/PUT)
  - /api/projects: create (POST), list (GET), detail (GET), update (PUT), delete (DELETE)
  - /api/deploy: create (POST), list (GET), update-status (POST)
  - /api/admin: stats, deployments, logs, worker/status, ai-service/status (all GET)
  - /auth/github, /github/repos, /github/deploy: GitHub OAuth and repo operations
- Frontend uses axiosConfig.js for API requests; no central service file, API logic handled via hooks (useProjects, useDeployments).
- App.js sets up all major routes; project and deployment pages are present.
- Only fix wiring and logic in existing files; avoid introducing new files or abstractions unless strictly necessary.
- ProjectsList now uses useProjects hook for state and API calls.
- DeploymentsList now uses useDeployments and useProjects hooks; styling matches LandingPage.
- DeploymentsList error UI now uses black/white theme and imports projectsError from useProjects.
- ProjectsList refactored to match LandingPage black/white theme, including cards, search, and error/loading UI.
- NewProject component refactored for black/white theme and backend connectivity.
- NewProject form and repo selector now use black/white theme, matching LandingPage style.
- All new/updated UI must use only black and white theme-aware colors (no color accents).
- Styling for new/updated components should follow LandingPage's approach, but limited to black/white.
- API endpoint discrepancies between hooks/components resolved; all use `/api/projects` via axiosConfig.js.
- axiosConfig.js confirmed to handle base URL and JWT correctly.
- Dashboard and main layout to be redesigned to match landing/login/register style (black/white, modern UI, do not touch those pages/components themselves).
- Login/auth persistence issue discovered: after login, user is redirected back to login page despite successful credentials.
- Investigated and fixed axios interceptor login path, ensured AuthContext sets token in axios headers after login and on app load, verified backend JWT config and login controller.
- Fixed login/auth persistence issue by:
  - Updating backend auth middleware to properly extract and verify JWT from Authorization header
  - Updating frontend axiosConfig.js to set Authorization header and handle 401 errors robustly
  - Updating AuthContext login function to set token and headers correctly, and ensure redirect after login
  - Updating Login page to clear old tokens and handle error state more clearly
- Login/auth persistence bug is now resolved; user remains logged in after successful login and can access protected routes.
- Updated backend CORS configuration to allow requests from frontend (localhost:3000), using explicit origins and credentials for security.
- Currently troubleshooting frontend "Network Error" (ERR_NETWORK) on login, despite backend working in Postman; suspect CORS or frontend-backend connectivity issue.
- Fixed all login/register 404 errors by ensuring axiosConfig.js and AuthContext consistently prefix all auth endpoints with `/api/`.
- Now troubleshooting 500 Internal Server Error from `/api/projects` (projects API) after login; investigating backend controller and integration with frontend hooks.
- No backend log files found for debugging 500 errors; proceeding via code inspection of controllers/models.
- Improved error handling and validation in backend `getProjects` controller for more detailed debugging of 500 errors.
- Updated frontend `useProjects` hook to match backend response format and improved error handling and endpoint alignment.
- Debugged and fixed 500 error on projects API.
- Backend project API currently broken: `req.user` is undefined because authentication middleware is not properly applied in project routes. Must fix middleware usage to restore project API security and functionality.
- Fixed authentication middleware usage in project routes; project API now properly sets `req.user` and is secure.
- Backend project API is now secure and functional.
- Authentication middleware is now directly imported as `authenticate` and applied as `protect` in project routes; server should start and API security is ensured.
- Dashboard UI/UX must be improved: remove emojis, unify background (remove blue, ensure theme switcher works on all elements), and make buttons/controls consistent and modern (black/white only).
- Dashboard and MainLayout.js are being refactored for a uniform black/white theme; blue backgrounds and inconsistent elements are being removed; theme toggling and button consistency are being addressed.
- Lint errors and JSX tag mismatches in MainLayout.js must be fixed after recent changes.
- Dashboard redesign must specifically match Landing Page button stylings, UI design, and dark mode implementation.
- Dashboard redesign should also ensure consistency with Landing Page's typography, spacing, and alignment.
- All lint and JSX errors in Dashboard.js have been fixed; Dashboard compiles cleanly.
- MainLayout.js header structure under review for breadcrumb removal and header simplification.
- Global scroll bar and card hover effect styles updated in index.css.
- Card hover effect must be subtle and not extreme black/white, for all cards (stats, quick actions, etc.), matching Landing Page polish.
- Borders in dashboard, sidebar, and other components are now thinner and more eye-friendly, while keeping color/styling as is.
- Header has been removed entirely from MainLayout (no Shard label, no theme toggle), and card hover states are subtle and not extreme black/white.
- Card hover effect is now subtle, with no extreme black/white, and header is removed from MainLayout as requested.
- All dropdown menus in MainLayout are now theme-aware and match the black/white design system.
- Dashboard buttons and cards should have clearly differentiated hover effects: cards use subtle shadow/lift, buttons use higher-contrast background and scale/active states.
- User requested that stats cards and quick action cards use a subtle light grey background on hover (not dark/black), and borders should remain unchanged. Button hover effects should remain distinct and higher-contrast.
- User reports non-uniformity in theme between Landing Page and Dashboard; dashboard theme appears inverted or inconsistent. Must investigate and resolve theme consistency across all main pages.
- Theme initialization and synchronization improved in ThemeContext to ensure consistent theme application across Landing Page, Dashboard, and all internal pages.

## Task List
- [ ] Step 3: Routing Fixes
  - Ensure all pages are linked in router config, remove dead routes, add missing ones, keep navigation consistent. Fix routing and wiring issues directly in existing files, not via new abstractions.
- [ ] Step 4: Logic Integration
  - Ensure frontend calls exist for every backend route, with proper loading, error, and success states. Match parameters. Create missing logic/components.
- [ ] Step 5: UI Consistency Pass
  - Standardize buttons, form fields, color palette, font scale, spacing, alignment, and typography.
- [ ] Step 6: Fragment-by-Fragment Refactoring
  - Edit small code fragments, keep structure/conventions unless buggy, test after each change.
- [ ] Step 7: Final Verification
  - Test app end-to-end, confirm backend route accessibility, UI consistency, remove unused files/vars/components.
  - Produce backend–frontend route map.
- [ ] Ensure design consistency in Projects page
  - [ ] Unify button styling (e.g., "Environment" button) with Dashboard
  - [ ] Update card hover effects to match Dashboard (subtle gray/white)
  - [ ] Standardize card border and shadow with Dashboard
  - [ ] Align spacing and typography with Dashboard
  - [x] Add root-level padding/margin to Projects page for layout consistency
  - [x] Remove blue background from Projects page; use only black or white
- [x] Ensure all buttons on Dashboard and Projects pages are fully functional
