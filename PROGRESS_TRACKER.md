SRE/DevOps Deployment System Wiring & Integrity Audit Report
Executive Summary
CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED - The system has 5 critical misconfigurations that will prevent successful automated deployments. Flask service is completely missing, Django paths are misaligned, and essential configuration files are absent.

Detailed Checklist
Dockerfile.flask Configuration
WORKDIR alignment: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: 
Dockerfile.flask
 expects /app/run.py but no Flask service exists in repository
Files: 
deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.flask
, missing run.py
Remediation: Create Flask service structure with run.py, 
app/init.py
, app/routes.py, 
app/models.py
Verification: find . -name "run.py" -o -name "app" -type d | grep -v node_modules
CMD entrypoint: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: CMD ["python", "run.py"] references non-existent file
Files: deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.flask:18
Remediation: Create run.py with proper Flask app factory import
Verification: docker build -f deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.flask .
requirements.txt: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: COPY requirements.txt . expects file at repo root, but only exists in ai-review/
Files: Missing /requirements.txt, exists at ai-review/requirements.txt
Remediation: Copy or create 
requirements.txt
 at repository root
Verification: ls -la requirements.txt
Dockerfile.django Configuration
WORKDIR alignment: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: Expects /app/sample_project/manage.py but actual path is /app/ai-review/manage.py
Files: deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django:9, 
ai-review/manage.py
Remediation: Change WORKDIR /app/sample_project to WORKDIR /app/ai-review
Verification: docker build -f deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django .
CMD entrypoint: ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN
Rationale: Uses runserver instead of production-ready gunicorn as mentioned in requirements
Files: deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django:23
Remediation: Change to CMD ["gunicorn", "ai_review.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
Verification: docker run -p 8000:8000 <image> gunicorn ai_review.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
requirements.txt reference: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: References ../requirements.txt but file doesn't exist at repo root
Files: deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django:13
Remediation: Create 
requirements.txt
 at repo root or adjust path to ai-review/requirements.txt
Verification: docker build -f deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django .
Entrypoints
Flask entrypoint: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: No run.py file exists to define Flask app object
Files: Missing run.py
Remediation: Create run.py with from app import create_app; app = create_app()
Verification: python run.py (after creation)
Django entrypoint: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: 
manage.py
 exists and correctly references ai_review.settings
Files: ai-review/manage.py:9, 
ai-review/ai_review/settings.py
Verification: cd ai-review && python manage.py check
Environment Configuration
Environment files: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: No .env or .env.example files found at repo root
Files: Missing .env, .env.example
Remediation: Create .env.example with required variables (SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, PORT, etc.)
Verification: ls -la .env*
Django settings: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: Properly configured with python-dotenv and environment variable fallbacks
Files: ai-review/ai_review/settings.py:15-29
Verification: cd ai-review && python -c "from ai_review import settings; print('OK')"
Ports & Health Endpoints
Flask ports: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: No Flask service exists to expose ports
Files: Missing Flask service
Remediation: Create Flask app with port configuration from environment
Verification: curl http://localhost:14000/health (after deployment)
Django health: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: Health endpoint exists at /health/
Files: ai-review/ai_review/urls.py:26
Verification: curl http://localhost:13000/health/
Static Assets
Flask static: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: No Flask app/static or app/templates directories exist
Files: Missing Flask service structure
Remediation: Create app/static/ and app/templates/ directories
Verification: ls -la app/static app/templates
Django static: ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN
Rationale: STATIC_URL defined but no STATIC_ROOT for production
Files: ai-review/ai_review/settings.py:120
Remediation: Add STATIC_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'staticfiles' to settings.py
Verification: cd ai-review && python manage.py collectstatic --dry-run
Database
Django migrations: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: Migrations directory exists and can generate new migrations
Files: ai-review/app/migrations/
Verification: cd ai-review && python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
Flask database: ‚ùå FAIL
Rationale: No Flask models.py or database initialization exists
Files: Missing Flask service
Remediation: Create Flask service with SQLAlchemy models
Verification: python -c "from app import db; print('OK')" (after creation)
Frontend ‚Üî Backend Wiring
API configuration: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: Frontend correctly configured for localhost:5000 backend API
Files: frontend/src/utils/axiosConfig.js:7
Verification: grep -r "localhost:5000" frontend/src/
Deployment Worker Consistency
Docker commands: ‚ö†Ô∏è WARN
Rationale: Worker expects both Flask and Django services but Flask is missing
Files: deployment-worker/utils/dockerHelpers.js:14,70
Remediation: Remove Flask references or create Flask service
Verification: node -c "const {buildAndRunContainer} = require('./deployment-worker/utils/dockerHelpers.js')"
Security
Dockerfile security: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: No hardcoded secrets, uses environment injection
Files: deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django:21, deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.flask:17
Verification: grep -r "password\|secret\|key" deployment-worker/dockerfiles/
Observability
Health endpoints: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: Health checks implemented for Django and deployment worker
Files: ai-review/ai_review/urls.py:26, deployment-worker/routes/health.js
Verification: curl http://localhost:9000/health && curl http://localhost:13000/health/
Logging: ‚úÖ PASS
Rationale: Comprehensive logging system with structured logs
Files: deployment-worker/services/jobProcessor.js:139-156
Verification: ls -la deployment-worker/logs/
Critical Issues (Priority Order)
üî• Flask Service Missing - Entire Flask service structure absent, breaking deployment worker
üî• Requirements.txt Missing - Both Dockerfiles expect 
requirements.txt
 at repo root
üî• Django Path Misalignment - Dockerfile expects /sample_project but actual is /ai-review
üî• Environment Configuration Missing - No .env files for service configuration
‚ö†Ô∏è Production Configuration - Django using development server instead of gunicorn
Missing Artifacts Needed
Deployment worker logs: tail -200 deployment-worker/logs/*.log
Docker build logs: docker build --progress=plain -f deployment-worker/dockerfiles/Dockerfile.django .
Container inspection: docker inspect <container-name>
Network connectivity: docker network ls && docker port <container-name>
Environment variable injection: docker exec <container> env | grep -E "(SECRET|DATABASE|PORT)"
Recommendation: Address critical issues 1-4 before attempting any automated deployments. The system is currently non-functional for Flask deployments and will fail Django deployments due to path misalignment.
