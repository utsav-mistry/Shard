## Deployment Worker Architecture

The Deployment Worker is the core component responsible for executing deployments. It operates as a standalone service that processes deployment jobs from a queue and manages the entire deployment lifecycle.

### Worker Components

#### Job Queue System
- **Queue Management**: In-memory job queue with FIFO processing
- **Job Persistence**: Jobs stored with project metadata and deployment parameters
- **Concurrency Control**: Sequential job processing to prevent resource conflicts
- **Error Handling**: Failed jobs logged with detailed error information

#### Repository Management
- **Git Cloning**: Clones repositories to isolated local directories
- **Branch Handling**: Supports main/master branch deployments
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of previous deployments
- **Version Control**: Maintains deployment history and rollback capabilities

#### Environment Variable Injection
- **Secure Retrieval**: Fetches encrypted environment variables from backend
- **Project Isolation**: Each project maintains separate environment configuration
- **Runtime Injection**: Environment variables injected into Docker containers
- **Validation**: Ensures environment variables meet security requirements

#### Docker Container Orchestration
- **Multi-Stack Support**: Pre-configured Dockerfiles for MERN, Django, and Flask
- **Port Management**: Dynamic port allocation to prevent conflicts
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints for container stability
- **Health Checks**: Container health monitoring and automatic restart

### Deployment Workflow

#### 1. Job Reception
```
Backend API → Job Queue → Worker Processing
```
- Backend creates deployment job with project metadata
- Job includes repository URL, stack type, and environment variables
- Worker polls queue every 5 seconds for new jobs

#### 2. Repository Processing
```
Git Clone → Code Analysis → Environment Setup
```
- Clones repository to `repos/{projectId}/` directory
- Performs AI code review for security and quality assessment
- Fetches and injects project-specific environment variables

#### 3. Container Build Process
```
Docker Build → Image Creation → Container Deployment
```
- Builds Docker image using stack-specific Dockerfile
- Creates container with unique subdomain and port mapping
- Starts container with environment variables and health monitoring

#### 4. Deployment Monitoring
```
Log Streaming → Status Updates → Health Monitoring
```
- Streams real-time logs to backend API
- Updates deployment status (pending, building, running, failed)
- Monitors container health and performance metrics

### Container Management

#### Port Allocation Strategy
- **MERN Stack**: Backend on port 12000, Frontend on port 12001
- **Django Stack**: Backend on port 13000
- **Flask Stack**: Backend on port 14000
- **Dynamic Mapping**: Host ports mapped to container ports

#### Resource Constraints
- **Memory Limit**: 512MB per container
- **CPU Allocation**: Fair share distribution
- **Storage**: Isolated file system per project
- **Network**: Containerized network isolation

#### Health Monitoring
- **Container Status**: Running, stopped, or failed states
- **Log Analysis**: Real-time log parsing and error detection
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Auto-Recovery**: Automatic restart on container failure

### Security Implementation

#### Environment Variable Security
- **Encryption**: Variables encrypted at rest in database
- **Runtime Decryption**: Secure decryption during deployment
- **Access Control**: Project-specific variable isolation
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of variable access and changes

#### Container Security
- **Isolation**: Complete container isolation from host system
- **Resource Limits**: Prevents resource exhaustion attacks
- **Network Security**: Isolated network for each container
- **Image Scanning**: Security scanning of base images

#### Access Control
- **Authentication**: JWT token validation for all operations
- **Authorization**: Project ownership verification
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and input validation
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of all operations

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### Deployment Failures
- **Build Failures**: Detailed error logging and user notification
- **Container Crashes**: Automatic restart with exponential backoff
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Graceful degradation and user alerts
- **Network Issues**: Retry mechanisms with circuit breaker pattern

#### Data Recovery
- **Repository Backup**: Local backup of cloned repositories
- **Configuration Backup**: Environment variable backup
- **Log Persistence**: Persistent storage of deployment logs
- **Rollback Capability**: Quick rollback to previous deployments

### Performance Optimization

#### Build Optimization
- **Layer Caching**: Docker layer caching for faster builds

- **Resource Pooling**: Efficient resource allocation and reuse
- **Cleanup Routines**: Automatic cleanup of unused resources

#### Monitoring and Metrics
