```

1. **Connect GitHub** - OAuth integration, instant repo access
2. **AI Reviews Your Code** - Security, quality, best practices check
3. **Auto-Deploy** - Docker containers with environment injection
4. **Monitor Live** - Real-time logs, metrics, health checks

## Architecture

**Microservices Design** for maximum reliability:

- **React Frontend** - Modern dashboard with real-time updates
- **Node.js API** - JWT auth, MongoDB, environment encryption  
- **Python AI Service** - Code analysis, security scanning
- **Docker Worker** - Container orchestration, deployment pipeline
- **Nginx Proxy** - Dynamic subdomain routing, SSL termination

## Security First

- **JWT Authentication** with refresh tokens
- **OAuth Integration** (GitHub, Google)  
- **Encrypted Environment Variables** at rest
- **AI Security Scanning** for vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting** and DDoS protection
- **Complete Audit Trails** for all operations

## Built to Scale

- **Horizontal Scaling** - Stateless API design
- **Docker Optimization** - Layer caching, resource limits
- **Performance Monitoring** - CPU, memory, network tracking
- **Auto-Recovery** - Container health checks, automatic restarts

## Modern Developer Experience
